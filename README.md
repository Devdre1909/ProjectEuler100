## Day 1 (Jan 6, 2020)
```p1-mutilpes-of-3-or-3.js```

Contains two methods: 
* *...rest* and *Array(n).keys()* to generate numbers, and *filter* the resulting [an array], the sum it up with *reduce*
* Use for loop to generate the numbers, check with if statement and for each passed condition increment *sum*

## Day 2(Jan 7, 2020)
```p2-Even-Fibonacci-Numbers.js```

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the nth term, find the sum of the even-valued terms

## Day 4 (Jan 16, 2020)
```p3-Largest-palindrome-product```

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.
